## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r macro data, echo = T}
#wrestle the data from chr type "%m/%d/%y" data to zoo type year month 
dta = read.csv("employment_dta.csv", col.names = c("month", "retail_trade_employment", "all_employment")) %>%
  mutate(month = yearmonth(
    as.Date(month, format = "%m/%d/%y"))
  ) %>%
  mutate(month = yearmonth(month))
as_tsibble(dta)
```

```{r sp500 performance data, echo =T}
#model 2
fit_1 = wh

         #retail_trade_employment = retail_trade_employment * 1000,
         #all_employment = all_employment*1000)
fc1 = forecast(fit1, h =12)
autoplot(fc1)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
