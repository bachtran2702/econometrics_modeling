## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r data, echo = T}
data = read.csv("base_model_data.csv")

as_tsibble(data, key = DATE)
```

```{r data}
#date parameter
start = 
end = Sys.Date()

# Pull stock data
# Assign SPY data to 'spy' using auto.assign argument
spy = getSymbols("SPY", auto.assign = F, from = "2019-01-01") 

# Assign JNJ data to 'jnj' using env argument
jnj = getSymbols("JNJ", auto.assign = F, from = "2019-01-01")

#Extract adjusted close
spy_adj = Ad(spy)
jnj_adj = Ad(jnj)

data = cbind.xts(spy_adj, jnj_adj) 
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Index)) +
    geom_line(aes(y = jnj_adj), color = "#ED3833") +
    geom_line(aes(y = spy_adj), color ="#073D7F") +
    labs(y = "Price ", x = "Year" )
                                              
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
